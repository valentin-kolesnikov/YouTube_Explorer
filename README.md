# 🌐How to download?

## Releases

Windows:
1. `Releases` → `YouTubeExplorer.zip`
2. Extract the `.zip` folder
3. `bin` → open `YouTubeExplorer.exe`

Ubuntu-like:
1. **Releases** → `YouTubeExplorer.tar.gz`
2. Extract the `.tar.gz` folder
3. YouTubeExplorer.dist → Copy `YouTubeExplorer.bin` → Paste it into the terminal and press Enter, or run it via command: `./YouTubeExplorer.bin`

## Git

1. Install `Git`
2. In the terminal, paste: `git clone https://github.com/valentin-kolesnikov/YouTube_Explorer`
3. Map to the folder and run the main script `YouTubeExplorer.py`
4. Type `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal to install all dependencies

# ❓How to get the YouTube Data API v3 key?

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)

2. You need to register for a Google account or log in to it.

3. Click the **Create or select a project** button in the center of the page → **New project**

4. Enter a project name (or leave the auto-generated one). → If you do not belong to an organisation, leave the **Location** as default. → Click **Create**.

5. On the same page, click **Select project** and choose your project. Type `YouTube Data API v3` in the search bar → click **Enable**

6. You will be redirected to the API configuration. In the left column, you should press **Credentials**.

7. At the top, click **Create credentials** → **API key**.

8. That is it! Copy your API key and paste it into YouTube Explorer. If you need, you can restore the key from the main menu.

# 🛡️ How to get OAuth 2.0 credentials?

- The application is designed to use **OAuth 2.0** as the primary authentication method
- If OAuth client secrets are not found, the system switches to the **YouTube Data API Key** method without interrupting the user

Since automated OAuth 2.0 registration isn't supported out-of-the-box, you will need to generate your own credentials by following these steps:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).

2. Select the project you already created for your YouTube Data API v3 key.

3. In the left column, click **OAuth consent screen**.

4. Choose **External** as the User Type and click **Create**.

5. Fill in the required fields: `App name`, `User support email`, and `Developer contact information` (you can use your own email for all of these). Click **Save and Continue**.

6. Skip the **Scopes** page by clicking **Save and Continue**.

7. On the **Test users** page, click **Add Users** and type in your own Google account email. Click **Save and Continue**.

8. Now, click on **Credentials** in the left column again.

9. At the top, click **Create credentials** → **OAuth client ID**.

10. Select **Desktop app** as the Application type. You can leave the default name. Click **Create**.

11. A window will pop up. Click **Download JSON** to save your credentials.

12. The downloaded `.json` file must be placed in the `Keys` folder of the `bin` folder.

# Core capabilities

## 🔑YouTube API key handling

- Initial validation of the provided API key before execution
- Automatic creation and storage of a `Key.bin` file
- Exclusion of re-entering the key after successful verification

## 🚪Quota inspection

- Detects current availability of the YouTube API quota
- Stops execution if further requests are not possible

## 💌Comment Explorer

- Get a list of comments on YouTube videos in the console
- Filter comments by keyword
- Sort `by time` or `by relevance`
- Limit the number of output results
- Identify the channel hosting the video
- NEW! Comment Explorer can save the collected data in a `.docx` file

## 📹Video Explorer

- Search for videos by your prompt
- Perform region-specific searches
- Apply optional filters such as: `publication date range` and `video duration`
- Control the maximum number of returned search results
- For each video, you will receive the following metadata:
   1. The title of the video
   2. Direct URL
   3. View count
   4. Like count
   5. Dislike count
   6. Comment count
   7. Publication date
   8. Channel name and channel URL

## 📈Channel Explorer

- Collect most of the channel statistics:
  - Subscriber count  
  - View count  
  - Description  
  - registration date
  - Channel ID (UC...)
  - Handle (@...)
- If necessary, you can search videos on the certain channel thanks to the Video Explorer components

## 🗂️Playlist Explorer

- Search for playlists using keywords, or securely load **your own** playlists using OAuth 2.0
- View basic playlist details, such as privacy status, total video count, and publication date
- Easily extract all videos from any playlist by entering its URL (supports both `PL...` and `OL...` links)
- Get detailed statistics for every video inside the playlist, complete with dislike counts
- Analyze a playlist's video library right after finding it, without needing to go back to the main menu

## 📄Subtitles Explorer

**Subtitles Explorer** makes extracting text from videos effortless and flexible

- You enter the two-letter language codes, such as `en` or `ru`
- It gives you the choice between `manually created` subtitles for better accuracy or `auto-generated` transcripts. The system is designed to handle missing data intelligently
- If your preferred transcript type is not available, it will not just show an error and stop. Instead, it detects the issue and offers the alternative version immediately, ensuring you can still retrieve the content you are looking for.

## 🔢Info Explorer

- Enter a specific video URL to directly extract metadata without searching
- Returns the complete information block detailed in [Video Explorer](#video-explorer) and, additionally, the video description

## 📖History Explorer

- Navigate through your past session logs chronologically
- Automatically structure and store session data in directories sorted by "`year` => `month` => `day`"
- View detailed information about previously executed tools (meanwhile Comment Explorer) and their specific actions

# ⚙️ Functionality

- **Authentication** — **OAuth 2.0** is prioritised for secure access. If OAuth credentials are not detected, the application uses the **YouTube Data API key** stored in `Key.bin`
- **Link parsing** — `video id`, `channel id` (UC...), and `handle` (@...) are automatically extracted from the links you enter
- **Search filters** — you can filter videos by `Region`, `Dimension` (2D or 3D), `Duration`, and `Date` (using the smart calendar)
- **Channel search** — unlike standard search, you can perform keyword searches specifically inside a channel's library
- **Smart Subtitles** — **YouTube Transcript API** is integrated. It looks for `manually created` subtitles first. If they are missing, it asks if you want `auto-generated` ones
- **Dislikes** — **Return YouTube Dislike API** is integrated to show dislike counts mixed with official data
- **Comment filtering** — **Keywords** are used to filter comments and replies locally. YouTube Data API does not do this filtering
- **Quota check** — a test request is made at the start to ensure your **YouTube API quota** is not exceeded before running
- **Automatic verification** — before making API requests, YouTube Explorer pings `google.com` to ensure your connection is active. If the connection is lost, you can retry connecting
- Receive detailed error messages if something goes wrong
- Now the main menu consists of two pages
- Restore your **YouTube API** key on the second page of the main menu
